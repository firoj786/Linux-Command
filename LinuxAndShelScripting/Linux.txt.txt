What is Linux Operation system ?

Linux is an Multi-User and Multi-tasking operating system that is feely distributed under GNU (general public license).



What is an operating system ,what does it do?
It acts as an layer between end-user and the hardware of the computer.All the instruction passed by the end-user will be translated into CPU Instruction set and gets them executed on the underlying HARDWARE .So that end-user can use the computer without worrying about the system /Hardware configuration of the machine.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Linux is an operating system =it is helpful for achieving hardware portability ,and interacts with the underlying hardware of machine .



Linux has a key component called "kernel"that defines the operating system.



UNIX=Commercial source /runtime
 
LINUX=Free distributed and freely modifiable (open source )="kernel"=command -line integration.



What is an operating System?

Acts an an interface between end-user and hardware of the computer along with that it helps us in achieving the hardware portability.



What is programming language ?

Programming language provides english like instruction set that can be used for programming the computer easily.
They provide compilers for every platform so that the instructions can be translated into platform.



Kernel?=core component of linux operating system that interfacts with the hardware of the computer .



Widows 10=cpu/ram =2ghb ram
Linux Ubuntu 20.0=300 MB RAM /1 core CPU.

What is the file system?

Organizing and storIng the data on the computer hardware .
2-File system is a technic or a way of storing and organizing the data on the physical storage devices of a computer like 1-Harddisk 2-Pendrive 3-CD Rom.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

What is file ?

File is a data structure in which we store the address location of the actual data where does is resides on the storage  device .
  
                                          Or

 It's a pointer to the actual location of the data on  storage  device.                                    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--->Linux operation system as part of it's installation creates some default files/directories on the storage device. it is important tha we understand the directory structure that would gets created out of box.


/[root]

|-/bin[binary /executable]=the linux system commands
.
          /bash commands are placed in this directory.


|-/boot=[boot loader file in starting the linux OS ]


|-/dev=[device all the system devices are mounted on/dev]
           
  [/dev/sdv0/][/dev/sdv1]


|-/mnt=[all the remote system directories are mounted into this directory].


|-/media=[headphones/music player]


|-/usr=[programs /softwares under this directory are shared to all users of linux]

|-/proc=[process under execution and their information is kept as files in this directory]


|-/lib=[shared libraries across the s/w will be placed here]


|-/tmp=[temporary system file]

|-/var=[linux system logs and very large files]

|-/etc=[linux system configurations files]


|-/opt=software package will be kept here
 

|-/sbin =super user bash command
 

|-/home=per user one home directory gets created .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shell=>Shell is a software program /utility program that provides bunch of commands using which we can 
Interact with kernal of the linux operating system.this helps us in ease the interactions with linux.



Basically there are 2 types shell are there.

---------Very very most command--------

Find=find is command used for finding the files on your linux files system based on name of the file.

Syntex :-
Find directory -name "[pattern]"[by default -print is enabled]

Find directory -name "pattern" -print [display the contents in one single line].=here we want find to look for a file under specified directory of that  pattern.print prints the complete path of the file from root location and by default print is enabled even don't pass.



Find directory -name "pattern" -empty=prints only the files which are empty.



Find directory -name "pattern" -exce command {} \;=-exec indicates execute the command supplied here by passing all the files matching with that criteria.



\;=termination of the command.

ls -Rlhr logs



Find directory -name "pattern" -o -name "pattern" = -o stands for "or" means either matching first pattern or matching second pattern.



find . -name "*.log"

find . -name "*.tmp"

find . -name "*.out"

find . -name ".log" -o -name ".out" -o -name "*.tmp"



find logs tmp -name ".log" -exec rm {} \; - o -name ".out"
 -exec rm {}\; -o -name "*.tmp" -exec rm {} \;



????????????????????????????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Grep=grep is command for searching a text in a file or find the matching contents files.



Syntex and options of the grep:-
Grep=text fileName=it searches for the given text in the specified.fike and prints matching lines.

Grep -R "text" directory =It searches recursively into all the files and and subdirectories with that matching content and display along with matching textline the patch of the file also.



Grep -n "text" fileName =along with matching lines it displays line number.

 

Grep -iR "text" directory =ignore case comparison.

Grep -oR "text" directory =output the matches in individual lines.

Grep -w "text" filename=matches the whole words.

Grep -c"text" filename=count of occurrences. 

Grep -digit "text" filename=display the no of lines around the matching lines.




Mostly linux operating system is used in server-based install[headless]

1.less computing resources 

2.highly secured

 

-----Very very Imp-----

Text Editor (CUI).

1.VIM [VI]

2.Nano 



------------VI----------

VI=Default text editor available in most of the linux distros.



--------------There Are 3 modes of VI Editor--------------

1.command mode
 
In command mode we can edit/input the text into the 
file/editor.here any key press we do will be taken as a command by editor and will perform a relevant operation.
To enter into command mode we need use [ESC] key.by default.

 

2.input Mode

Input mode any key press will be taken as input and will writes on to the file to enter into input mode you should press [i] key on the keyword.



3.Exit Mode
 
In this we are going to quit from the editor.
First we should be back to command mode by [ESC] and should type :q[quit].



VI filename [existing file open it's contents][new file shows as blank]



With the default installation of Ubuntu vi older version will be prasent.Now we can upgrade latest VIM editor by doing the below.



Sudo apt-get update 

Sudo apt-get install vim 



What are the command we use in vi in command mode.

A=append the contents to the end of the file.

a=appends the contents from the current cursor position
 
I=insert contents from the beginning of the line.

i=insert contents from the current cursor position.

R=replace character from current cursor position.

S=replace the entire line.

YY=yank(copy)

2YY=copy 2 lines.

P=paste

X=to delete a character.

DW=delete word.

2 dd=delete 2 line.

o=open a new line below the cursor position. 

O=open a new line above the cursor position.

b=move cursor back to words at the ends of the word
 
w=forward to the next word
 
e=move cursor to the end of the current word 

u=undo

[ESC]:1=to goto the beginning of the first line 
Shift+G=end of the file.

:q=quit 

:w=write 

:q!=quit with out saving.
 
[ESC]\=Searching a word then press enter 
If we press  "N" next word  "B" previous word matching [ESC]

Ctrl+f=page forward 

Ctrl+b=page backward 

Gedit

 firoj.txt

nano editor 

nano filename 

Ctrl+o=save file
 
Ctrl+x=quit

User management
 
Linux is a multi-user operating system ,multiple users can login and access the system resources at the same time.



In Linux we have two types of users
 
1.ROOT user=there can be only 1 ROOT user of a Linux install.he has total control of the enter system resource.

1.1 CREATE OTHER USERS 

1.2 MODIFY OTHER USERS 

1.3 CAN MANAGE ANY FILES ON THE DEVICE
 
1.4 CAN MANAGE PROCES 



2.Normal user =Other than the one ROOT any user we add into linux becomes Normal User.
The Normal user can only see /his/her file under the user home directory but can not have access to any system resource.



Useradd username
 
useradd -u uid -g gid -d /home/directory -s shell 

sudo su - =will switch the user into root prompt 
By default th terminal will not be opened with root privilige
To protected accidental damage to the system resuorce.

sudo su -




Packaging and compression
 
If i want to package the contents of a directory or group of file together into one single file then use packaging.

tar  --usage | grep add

tar=tarball

-x=extracting 

-v=verbose
 
-f=archive name

-t=table of contents
 
-c=create
 
--delete =to delete a file inside the tar 

--add-f=to add a file into existing tar

tar -- delete -f firoj.tar index.jpeg

 

What is the different between a ROOT AND SUDOERS?

A ROOT user can perform any operation on the linux machine like adding a user or removing /disabling the user ,but a sudoer can only perform super user commands only cannot change any other user on Linux system.




Networking command 

sudo apt-get install -y net-tool=install net-tools package for using ifconfig command.

Ifconfig=displays the ip address and network adapter information.



ping serverName=checks the communication line b/w client and the server and rate of transmission.



Whoami=current logged in user information
 
logname



Users 

Who=both commands returns currently logged in users of the linux

 

hostname =name of the computer
 
hostname -i=ip addressed
 
Ifconfig=net-tools package should be installed 

Ping=to reach the destination server

free -h =ram space
 
Top=show all the current running process of the machine.



??????????????????????????????????????

cat/proc/cpuinfo=file contains the information about the processor of your machine.

lshw=list hardware computer
 
reboot=reboot computer
 
reboot -f=fast reboot
 
Init 0=power off

Init 6=restart 



???????????????????????????????????????????????????

df -k

du -sh filename 

Mount=points 


Process related command 

top=to see the process running on the linux system
 
PID=process id 

USER=owner
 
PR

Ni=Nice Value 

VIRT=virtual memory 

RES =reserved memory 

SHR=shared memory 
 S=status 

 %CPU 

 %MEM 
 
TIME+ COMMAND =command used to run the process 


  ps=process status 
 
ps -UX=current user running process including background process.

 P
 
ps -ef=show all the user process running on the system



How to kill a running process
 
Kill[PID]

kil
l -9 [PID]=forceful termination 



What is a process.
Program under execution is called a process.


There are 2 types of process are there in Linux 

1.Foreground process=upon running a program on a shell by default the process execute as a foreground 
Process, this means it blocks the shell and allows the user to interact with the program.
We can terminate these programs by pressing ctrl+c.



In a foreground process if we close the terminal window linux will send an hangup signal to the program asking to terminate so that program execution will be stopped and quit.


Long running programs 



2.background process =Background process returns the terminal window of the user and doesn't allow the user to interact with the program.the only way to monitor the program is using top /ps and to stop execution we need to use kill.



There are two ways in running a program as a background program.

1.command &=this makes the program run as background
 
2.nohup command =nohup stands for no hangup.
So even we terminate the shell the nohup will not passes the hangup single to the command making it run for long time.

There difference b/w nohup and & is
 
Bash cal.sh &=the output will be redirected to standout.and if we close the console the output will be lost.

nohup bash cal.sh &=nohup automatically redirects the output of the background process the default file called nohup.out.
so that we see the output of the program.
nohup will not runs the. Program in background it helps only in redirecting.
